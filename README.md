# adventuretron

Create self-guided workshops using electron.

## Work in progress

Basically nothing works yet :laugh:. But check back! I'm not done yet!

## Open Questions

This is still early in development, so there are a few undecided elements of this project that you might be able to help with. Each item below has a corresponding [issue](/issues).

### Would a different name be better?

I like imagining a robot named `adventuretron` adventuring around the interwebs teaching technology & advancing digital equity. But it's not really a clear name. It does reasonably portray the origins and prior art of the project: a library based on [adventure]() that depends on [electron](). Your thoughts?
[Issue #1](issues/1)

### Are you trying to make workshops that run as both websites & electron apps?

There are some file system limitations to building apps that work on the web compared to building them as electron apps. But maybe those can be overcome?
